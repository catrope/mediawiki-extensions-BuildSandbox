<!--
	Vite uses HTML files as entry points during development.
	In MediaWiki, this could allow developers to develop modules
	in isolation from the larger MW environment, gaining benefits
	like Hot Module Replacement during development.

	If multiple modules are being developed within a single extension
	this way, each one could have its own index.html entry point for
	development.
